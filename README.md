Installing wordpress and MySQL by help of docker
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services.
Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration
I have used WordPress  which is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL which is also an open-source relational database management system.
